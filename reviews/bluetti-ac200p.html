                        <h2>What We Tested and How</h2>
                        <p>We ran the AC200P as the only power source for a 3-day off-grid stay at a cabin in northern Oregon. No grid tie-in, no generator backup. Solar input came from a pair of 200W panels (400W total, well under the 700W max input) via a 10-gauge cable direct to the AC200P's MPPT solar port.</p>

                        <p>Load profile over 3 days:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>12V LED lighting (total draw ~30W, 6&ndash;8 hours/night)</li>
                            <li>Laptop charging (65W, ~4 hours/day)</li>
                            <li>Phone charging (3 devices, ~20W combined)</li>
                            <li>Small electric kettle (1,000W, used 3x/day for ~3 minutes each)</li>
                            <li>Mini fridge (150W average running draw, operated 18 hours/day)</li>
                            <li>CPAP machine (30W, 8 hours/night)</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>Total estimated daily load: approximately 820Wh. We tracked state of charge at 8-hour intervals via the display.</p>
                    </section>

                    <section>
                        <h2>Real-World Performance</h2>

                        <p>Day 1 started at 100% (2,000Wh). By 8pm after a full day of the above load profile, we were at 62% &mdash; roughly 760Wh consumed in ~12 hours, consistent with the estimated draw.</p>

                        <p>The mini fridge was the dominant load. Running it from 6am to midnight (18 hours) at an average 150W compressor draw (actual measured with a kill-a-watt was 148W average including cycling) consumed ~2,664Wh over the 3 days. Solar input over the same period in mostly overcast Oregon conditions: approximately 900Wh total (300Wh/day average from 400W of panels). Net daily deficit: ~520Wh after solar.</p>

                        <p>By the end of day 3, the AC200P was at 22% &mdash; approximately 440Wh remaining. We never cut the fridge or reduced loads. That's 3 days of comfortable cabin power from a single charge with partial cloud solar recovery.</p>

                        <div class="info-box neutral">
                            <p class="info-box-title">Key Measurement</p>
                            <p>Actual usable capacity tested was approximately 1,780Wh (89% of rated 2,000Wh). This is normal for LiFePO4 chemistry &mdash; the BMS reserves headroom at both ends of the charge curve. The advertised 2,000Wh figure is total cell capacity, not usable capacity.</p>
                        </div>

                        <h3>High-Load Testing (AC Output)</h3>
                        <p>The AC200P's 2,000W continuous AC output (4,800W surge) handled everything we threw at it cleanly. The electric kettle (1,000W) ran without any issues. An angle grinder (1,200W), tested briefly, started without hesitation.</p>

                        <p>We didn't attempt to run anything near the 2,000W continuous limit in sustained use &mdash; a 1,500W space heater would drain the unit in about 1 hour and 15 minutes, making it impractical for heating applications. The AC200P is not a substitute for a wood stove or propane heater. It's best suited for electronics, moderate appliances, and short-duration high-draw tasks.</p>

                        <h3>Solar Charging</h3>
                        <p>The AC200P's MPPT controller accepts 35&ndash;150V DC input at up to 12A. Our 400W array (two 200W panels in series, Voc ~48V each, combined ~96V) paired cleanly. The controller reported accurate wattage input on the display.</p>

                        <p>Maximum solar input is 700W &mdash; meaning you can run up to 700W of panels simultaneously. At 700W input in full sun, you're adding approximately 700Wh per hour, fully recharging the unit in under 3 hours of peak solar. In practice, expect 4&ndash;6 hours for a full solar recharge in good conditions.</p>

                        <p>The 700W max is competitive but not leading-edge &mdash; the Jackery 1000 Pro maxes at 400W, while the EcoFlow DELTA Pro accepts up to 1,600W. If fast solar recharging is a priority, the AC200P's 700W cap is worth noting.</p>

                        <h2>What to Look for When Buying a 2,000Wh Power Station</h2>

                        <p>The AC200P fits a specific use case well: cabin backup power, emergency home power, or weekend off-grid use where portability isn't critical. Before buying, verify:</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Daily load calculation.</strong> Add up your daily Wh consumption (watts &times; hours per day) and multiply by 1.25 for safety margin. If your daily load exceeds 1,600Wh, the AC200P will be depleted daily without solar &mdash; which may be acceptable with adequate panel wattage.</li>
                            <li><strong>Solar input vs. panel capacity.</strong> 700W max input is sufficient for most 2&ndash;4 panel setups. Ensure your panel Voc stays under 150V and current under 12A.</li>
                            <li><strong>Weight tolerance.</strong> If you need to move this regularly, the 60.6 lbs is a genuine limitation. A Jackery Explorer 1000 Pro at 25 lbs is more practical for transport at half the capacity.</li>
                            <li><strong>Expandability needs.</strong> The AC200P has no expansion option. If you might need more storage later, EcoFlow's DELTA series allows battery stacking.</li>

                        <div class="info-box success">
                            <p class="info-box-title">Verdict: Recommended &mdash; 8/10</p>
                            <p>The Bluetti AC200P is a well-built, reliable power station that delivers on its core promise: substantial off-grid power in a single unit. LiFePO4 chemistry at this price tier is a genuine long-term value proposition &mdash; 3,500 cycles means a decade of regular use before meaningful capacity degradation.</p>
                            <p>Its limits are real: not expandable, not portable in any practical sense, and its 700W solar input, while competitive, has been exceeded by newer platforms. If you're building a permanent off-grid setup and need more than 2,000Wh, step up to the EcoFlow DELTA Pro or Bluetti's own AC300 system.</p>
                            <p>For most off-grid cabin and emergency backup applications where the unit stays in one place, the AC200P is recommended without hesitation. It does exactly what a 2,000Wh station should do, reliably, for years.</p>
