            <!-- What We Tested -->
            <h2>What We Tested and How</h2>

            <p>The Explorer 1000 Pro was tested in two distinct scenarios: a 2-day car camping and overlanding trip in the Oregon Coast Range, and a 72-hour grid-down simulation at a residential property. Both tests pushed the unit through realistic load cycles — not benchmarks.</p>

            <p>Overlanding test load profile (2 days):</p>
            <ul>
                <li>12V compressor cooler (50W average draw, 20 hours/day)</li>
                <li>Laptop (65W, 3 hours/day)</li>
                <li>Phone + camera battery charging (60W combined, 2 hours/day)</li>
                <li>LED camp lighting (15W, 5 hours/night)</li>
                <li>Occasional air pump use (150W peak, ~10 minutes total)</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Grid-down simulation (72-hour residential test):</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Mini fridge (150W average, 16 hours/day)</li>
                <li>LED lighting for 3 rooms (~45W, 5 hours/night)</li>
                <li>Device charging (laptops, phones, ~80W combined, 3 hours/day)</li>
                <li>No solar input during this test (indoor simulation)</li>
            </ul>

            <!-- Performance -->
            <h2>Real-World Performance</h2>

            <h3>Overlanding Test</h3>
            <p>Starting at 100% (1,002Wh), the overlanding load profile consumed approximately 450Wh per day. With two 200W Jackery SolarSaga panels paired (400W max, 380W realistic in Pacific Northwest sun conditions), daily solar input averaged ~650Wh — net positive energy balance of approximately 200Wh/day. We never dropped below 40% charge over the 2-day test.</p>

            <p>The 25.4 lb weight was the deciding factor in taking this rather than the Bluetti AC200P for this test. One person can carry it. The recessed handle design is functional. Compare this to the AC200P's 60.6 lbs, which requires a cart or two people for any real transport.</p>

            <h3>Grid-Down Simulation</h3>
            <p>No solar recharging, pure draw test. Estimated daily load: ~660Wh. The unit reached 0% early on hour 29 — delivering approximately 900Wh of usable capacity from 1,002Wh rated (89.8% usable ratio, consistent with the AC200P test). The mini fridge ran for 26 hours before the unit shut down protecting the battery.</p>

            <p>For a 72-hour grid outage with these loads, a single Explorer 1000 Pro is not sufficient. You'd need two units or a larger capacity station. For a 24–36 hour outage covering essential loads only, it's adequate.</p>

            <div class="info-box neutral">
                <strong>Tested Usable Capacity:</strong> 900Wh from 1,002Wh rated. Consistent with manufacturer specs and the general LFP/NMC pattern of ~89% accessible capacity at normal operating temperatures. In cold conditions (below 40°F), NMC chemistry loses capacity faster than LiFePO4 — a relevant trade-off for winter use.
            </div>

            <!-- High Load Testing -->
            <h3>High-Load Testing</h3>
            <p>The 1,000W continuous AC output handled a small microwave (1,000W rated, typically 800–850W actual draw) without issue. It handled a power drill (700W), small circular saw (1,400W peak — within the 2,000W surge spec, ran normally), and a coffee maker (900W).</p>

            <p>At 1,000W continuous draw, you'll deplete the unit in approximately 54 minutes from full charge. This is not a power tool station for sustained work. It's adequate for brief, high-draw tasks (boiling water, running a saw for a cut or two, short microwave use) punctuated by lower-draw periods.</p>

            <!-- App and Smart Features -->
            <h3>Jackery App and Smart Features</h3>
            <p>The Jackery app (Bluetooth + WiFi, depends on unit firmware) provides remote monitoring of SoC, watts in/out, and estimated runtime. In practice, the app is useful for glanceable status without walking to the unit. The remote on/off feature worked reliably in our test.</p>

            <p>The AC200P has no equivalent app feature on older units (Bluetti added it via firmware later). For users who want smart monitoring, the 1000 Pro has a meaningful advantage here.</p>

                        <li>1,000W AC output limit — can't run a 1,200W appliance (compared to AC200P's 2,000W)</li>
                        <li>3 AC outlets only (vs. 6 on AC200P)</li>

            <p>If you charge and discharge this unit once daily, NMC's 1,000-cycle life translates to roughly 2.7 years before hitting 80% capacity. LiFePO4 at 3,500 cycles gives you 9.5 years at the same usage rate. For occasional use (once or twice a week), NMC is fine — the math extends to 9+ years. For daily off-grid living, LiFePO4 is the correct choice.</p>

            <!-- Buying Guide Context -->
            <h2>What to Look for When Buying a 1,000Wh Portable Station</h2>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Portability requirement.</strong> If you need to carry it more than 50 feet, weight is a primary factor. The 1000 Pro's 25.4 lbs is a genuine differentiator. If it stays on a shelf, weight barely matters.</li>
                <li><strong>Use frequency.</strong> Daily use → prioritize LiFePO4. Weekly or occasional use → NMC is acceptable.</li>
                <li><strong>Peak load requirement.</strong> The 1000 Pro's 1,000W limit and 2,000W surge handles most appliances. If you need to run a 1,500W+ appliance continuously (space heater, larger microwave), step up to a 2,000W output unit.</li>
                <li><strong>Cold climate operation.</strong> Below 40°F / 4°C, NMC loses 10–25% capacity. LiFePO4 loses 5–15% in the same range. For consistent winter use, this is a real difference.</li>
                <li><strong>Recharge speed priority.</strong> The 1000 Pro's 1.8-hour AC recharge is fast. If you need to top up quickly between uses, this matters.</li>
            </ul>

            <!-- Final Verdict -->
            <div class="info-box success">
                <strong>Final Verdict — 8/10</strong>
                <p>The Jackery Explorer 1000 Pro is the best portable power station for users who actually move their unit — camping, overlanding, job site power, emergency deployment. At 25.4 lbs with 1,002Wh and a 1,000W output, it hits a practical sweet spot for mobile use.</p>
                <p>Its limitations are real: NMC chemistry means a shorter lifespan under heavy cycle use, and 1,000W output won't run certain high-draw appliances. For a fixed installation or daily off-grid use, the Bluetti AC200P's LiFePO4 chemistry and 2,000W output at 60 lbs is the better technical choice despite the portability penalty.</p>
                <p>For most off-grid homesteaders who need a unit that travels: the Explorer 1000 Pro is recommended without hesitation for occasional to moderate use patterns.</p>
