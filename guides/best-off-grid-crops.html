                        <h2>How to Choose Crops for Food Security</h2>
                        <p>A decorative garden and a food-security garden are different projects. Off-grid gardening means growing crops that actually sustain you &mdash; not just crops that are fun to grow or that look beautiful. That requires thinking in three dimensions: <strong>calorie density</strong> (how much energy per square foot), <strong>preservation ease</strong> (how long the harvest lasts without refrigeration), and <strong>drought tolerance</strong> (how well it performs when rainfall is short).</p>
                        <p>The crops on this list score well across all three. They are not exhaustive &mdash; your climate, soil, and preferences matter &mdash; but these ten are a practical foundation for almost any temperate off-grid food garden.</p>

                            <p class="info-box-title">A Note on Seed Saving</p>
                            <p>For genuine food security, grow open-pollinated (OP) or heirloom varieties of every crop on this list. OP varieties can be saved and replanted year after year, eliminating dependence on commercial seed sources. Hybrid (F1) seeds produce excellent first-year crops but do not breed true from saved seed.</p>

                        <h2>The Top 10 Off-Grid Crops</h2>

                        <h3>1. Potatoes</h3>
                        <p>Calorie for calorie, white potatoes are among the most productive food crops you can grow. A well-tended 100 sq ft bed can yield 50&ndash;100 lbs of potatoes, providing a significant portion of a person&rsquo;s daily caloric needs. They store for 6&ndash;10 months in a cool, dark root cellar with no processing required. Moderate water needs but tolerant of variable rainfall once established.</p>

                        <h3>2. Sweet Potatoes</h3>
                        <p>A warm-season powerhouse. Sweet potatoes are extraordinarily drought-tolerant once established, fixing their own soil with minimal fertilizer needs. They produce reliably in poor soil where other crops fail. Store for 6&ndash;12 months in cured conditions (warm and humid for 1&ndash;2 weeks after harvest, then cool and dry). A superior calorie crop for southern and warm-climate off-grid gardens.</p>

                        <h3>3. Winter Squash</h3>
                        <p>Butternut, Hubbard, Delicata, and similar thick-skinned squash varieties are exceptional storage crops. Properly cured (10&ndash;14 days at 80&ndash;85&deg;F after harvest), winter squash keeps for 3&ndash;6 months at room temperature with no refrigeration, canning, or processing. Each plant takes a fair amount of horizontal space but produces 2&ndash;5 large fruits. High in vitamin A and complex carbohydrates.</p>

                        <h3>4. Dried Beans</h3>
                        <p>The most important protein crop for an off-grid garden. Pinto, black, kidney, navy, and cannellini beans all dry on the vine and store in jars for 2&ndash;3 years. They fix nitrogen in the soil (benefiting everything else in your garden), require moderate water, and are among the easiest crops to save seed from. A 200 sq ft bean patch can produce 20&ndash;40 lbs of dried beans &mdash; significant dietary protein and calories for the space.</p>

                        <h3>5. Corn (Dent or Flint Varieties)</h3>
                        <p>For off-grid food production, field corn (dent or flint varieties) for drying and grinding is far more valuable than sweet corn. Dried corn stores for years in a sealed container, can be ground into cornmeal or grits, and provides dense calories. It&rsquo;s labor-intensive at scale but a staple food that pairs well with beans (they complement each other nutritionally and grow together in the traditional &ldquo;Three Sisters&rdquo; planting with squash).</p>

                        <h3>6. Garlic</h3>
                        <p>Garlic punches far above its weight for an off-grid garden. It stores for 6&ndash;12 months braided or hung in a dry location, has significant medicinal value, and improves the flavor of almost everything in your pantry. Plant in fall for summer harvest. Each planted clove produces a full bulb, and you replant from your own harvest &mdash; making it completely self-sustaining once you have your first crop.</p>

                        <h3>7. Onions</h3>
                        <p>Cured onions store for 3&ndash;8 months depending on variety, requiring no processing. Long-day varieties (northern gardens) and short-day varieties (southern gardens) are both available as open-pollinated seed. Onions are space-efficient, can be grown intensively, and form the flavor base of virtually every preserved and cooked meal. Yellow storage onions outperform sweet or red onions for long-term shelf life.</p>

                        <h3>8. Kale and Hardy Greens</h3>
                        <p>While greens score poorly on calorie density compared to roots and grains, they are nutritional workhorses providing vitamins C, K, and A that calorie-dense storage crops largely lack. Kale is cold-hardy to well below freezing, continues producing through light frosts, and can be dehydrated or fermented (kimchi-style) for longer storage. Include at least one reliable green on every off-grid plot &mdash; nutrient deficiency is a real risk in heavy-starch diets.</p>

                        <h3>9. Tomatoes</h3>
                        <p>Tomatoes have lower calorie density than root vegetables, but their versatility for preservation &mdash; canning, drying, sauce-making, salsa &mdash; and their role in feeding a household through winter make them essential. A productive indeterminate variety in full sun can yield 20&ndash;30 lbs per plant. Heirloom paste varieties (San Marzano, Amish Paste, Opalka) are ideal for processing. Moderate water needs; consistent irrigation produces the best yields.</p>

                        <h3>10. Sunflowers</h3>
                        <p>An often-overlooked food crop. Oil-type sunflower varieties produce seeds with 600+ calories per cup, rich in healthy fats, vitamin E, and minerals. They dry on the head, are easy to harvest and store, and can be cold-pressed into cooking oil with the right equipment. As a bonus, sunflowers attract pollinators, their stalks make biomass, and the heads provide wildlife feed in winter. Extraordinarily drought-tolerant.</p>

                        <h2>How Much Land Do You Actually Need?</h2>
                        <p>Caloric self-sufficiency for one person on a diversified vegetable garden requires roughly 4,000&ndash;8,000 sq ft of productive growing space (about 0.1&ndash;0.2 acres) under intensive cultivation. That assumes good soil, consistent water, and experience. Beginners should plan for lower yields and more space in their first few seasons.</p>
                        <p>A practical starting point for a couple: 2,000&ndash;3,000 sq ft of raised beds or well-prepared in-ground garden focused on this crop list. This won&rsquo;t achieve full caloric self-sufficiency, but it will provide a meaningful proportion of your food, build your skills, and give you a realistic picture of what expansion looks like.</p>

                        <div class="info-box tip">
                            <p class="info-box-title">Start With the Storage Crops First</p>
                            <p>In your first growing season, prioritize the crops with the longest shelf life: potatoes, dried beans, winter squash, garlic, and onions. These give you food security that extends months past harvest without requiring complex preservation equipment. Tomatoes and greens are excellent, but they are less forgiving of preservation mistakes and add food only in season or if you have canning infrastructure.</p>
