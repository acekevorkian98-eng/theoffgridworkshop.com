                        <h2>Why a Cob Oven</h2>
                        <p>Wood-fired ovens reach 700&ndash;900&deg;F &mdash; temperatures that turn bread into something genuinely different from anything you can make in a domestic electric oven. The thermal mass of the cob dome stores heat and releases it evenly over hours, giving you descending-temperature baking that is ideal for bread (high heat initial burst for oven spring, then dropping temperature for a long, even bake). The same oven fire that bakes your bread can also roast a chicken, cook beans overnight, and dry herbs.</p>
                        <p>For off-grid living, the advantage is complete independence from electricity for baking. A fire from your woodpile or scavenged fuel runs the oven. Materials are clay, sand, straw &mdash; things you likely have or can get cheaply locally.</p>
                    </section>

                    <section>
                        <h2>How a Cob Oven Works</h2>
                        <p>The principle is thermal mass. You build a fire inside the dome for 1.5&ndash;3 hours, heating the cob walls to 600&deg;F+. When the fire has burned to coals, you rake them out (or push them to the side for retained-heat cooking), and slide the bread in. The dome radiates stored heat evenly from all sides &mdash; top and bottom simultaneously &mdash; with no hot spots or cold spots.</p>
                        <p>The door-to-dome height ratio is critical: the door opening should be 63% of the interior dome height. This ratio controls draft and heat retention. A door that is too tall loses heat; too short and the fire smothers.</p>

                        <h2>Building the Foundation and Stand</h2>
                        <p>The oven needs to be at a comfortable working height &mdash; typically waist-height (32&ndash;36 inches). Build a stand from cinderblocks, stone, or timber to reach this height on a level, stable base. Fill the interior of the stand with rubble, gravel, or broken concrete to create a thermal mass base that holds heat. Top with a 4-inch layer of sand as an insulating pad, then lay your fire bricks flat on the sand to form the oven floor.</p>
                        <p>The fire brick floor is the part that takes the most abuse. Lay them without mortar, level and tightly fitted. A 24-inch diameter oven floor gives you room for two large loaves; 30 inches accommodates three or a large pizza.</p>

                    <section>
                        <h2>The Cob Mix</h2>
                        <p>Cob is a mixture of clay, sand, and straw. The ratio for oven cob is approximately 1 part clay to 1 part sand (no straw) for the inner thermal layer &mdash; straw burns out of the inner layer during high-temperature firings, weakening it. The outer insulating layer uses clay-sand-straw cob in a ratio of roughly 1:1:2 by volume.</p>
                        <p>Test your clay: grab a fist-sized ball and let it dry. If it shrinks massively and cracks, it&rsquo;s too much clay &mdash; add sand. If it crumbles when dry, not enough clay &mdash; add clay. A workable cob mix should form a ball that holds its shape when squeezed, doesn&rsquo;t stick aggressively to your hands, and has no large lumps.</p>

                    <section>
                        <h2>Building the Dome</h2>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Make the sand form:</strong> pile damp sand on the fire brick floor into a dome shape. Pack it firmly. The inside diameter should be 24&ndash;30 inches; height approximately 16&ndash;20 inches. Cover the sand with a single layer of damp newspaper &mdash; this tells you where the sand form ends when you excavate it later.</li>
                            <li><strong>Apply the inner thermal layer:</strong> pack 3&ndash;4 inches of clay-sand cob (no straw) firmly over the entire sand dome. Work from the base up in horizontal bands, pressing firmly to eliminate voids. Let this layer stiffen for several hours before continuing.</li>
                            <li><strong>Cut the door opening:</strong> once the inner layer is leather-hard (firm but not fully dry), mark and cut the door opening. The opening should be centered at the front, approximately 8&ndash;10 inches wide. Height = 63% of interior dome height. A straight edge saw or knife through the still-workable cob works well.</li>
                            <li><strong>Excavate the sand form:</strong> scoop out the sand through the door opening. The newspaper layer tells you when you&rsquo;ve reached the inner cob surface. Save the sand for later use.</li>
                            <li><strong>Apply the outer insulating layer:</strong> 3&ndash;4 inches of clay-sand-straw cob over the entire dome. This layer retains heat during baking. A second outer layer of pure straw-clay slip (very wet clay mix) applied as a finish coat improves weather resistance.</li>
                            <li><strong>Dry thoroughly:</strong> allow 1&ndash;2 weeks of air drying before the first fire. Do not rush this with a large fire &mdash; rapid drying causes cracking.</li>
                        </ol>
                    </section>

                    <section>
                        <h2>Curing and the First Fires</h2>
                        <p>Cure the oven over 3&ndash;5 progressively larger fires to drive out moisture without cracking:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Fire 1:</strong> small candle or very small twig fire, 30 minutes</li>
                            <li><strong>Fire 2 (next day):</strong> small fire, 45&ndash;60 minutes</li>
                            <li><strong>Fire 3:</strong> medium fire, 1 hour</li>
                            <li><strong>Fires 4&ndash;5:</strong> larger fires building toward full temperature</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Some hairline cracking is normal during curing. Fill cracks with a thin clay-sand slip (the consistency of heavy cream) pressed firmly into the crack with a finger. Deep structural cracks (&frac14;&Prime; or wider) indicate too-rapid drying or a mix that was too clay-heavy; patch and add more sand to subsequent repairs.</p>
                    </section>

                    <section>
                        <h2>Baking in a Cob Oven</h2>
                        <p><strong>For bread:</strong> build a full fire and keep it going for 2 hours minimum. At temperature, the inside of the dome will be white or pale gray (all carbon burned off). Rake coals out or push to the sides. Check temperature with a laser thermometer or the classic method &mdash; toss a small piece of newspaper in; if it ignites immediately, it&rsquo;s too hot. If it browns in 5 seconds, it&rsquo;s ready for bread (around 450&ndash;500&deg;F). Slide loaves in, seal the door, and wait 30&ndash;45 minutes.</p>
                        <p><strong>For pizza:</strong> fire with coals pushed to one side. Pizza at high heat (700&deg;F+) cooks in 90&ndash;120 seconds. Rotate halfway through with a peel.</p>
                        <p><strong>Retained heat cooking:</strong> after bread baking, the oven is still hot enough to roast vegetables, cook beans in a covered pot, or dehydrate herbs &mdash; in descending temperature order over 4&ndash;8 hours from a single fire.</p>

                        <div class="info-box tip">
                            <p class="info-box-title">Keep a Firing Log</p>
                            <p>Track how long you fire, with what wood, and what temperatures you achieve at what times. After a dozen firings, you&rsquo;ll know exactly how much wood and time your specific oven needs for each baking task. Every oven behaves slightly differently.</p>
                        </div>
                    </section>

                    <section>
                        <h2>Weather Protection</h2>
                        <p>An outdoor cob oven must have a roof over it &mdash; even a simple lean-to covered with metal roofing. Rain on a hot or warm oven causes thermal shock cracking. Rain on a cold oven slowly erodes the outer clay surface. A simple 4-post shelter over the oven pays for itself in reduced maintenance. Alternatively, apply a limewash or earthen plaster finish annually to maintain the outer surface.</p>
