                    <p>We bought our Excalibur 3926T in late 2023 after our third low-cost stackable dehydrator failed mid-harvest. We've run it nearly every week since — herbs from the garden, venison jerky from the fall hunt, apple and pear slices from the orchard, foraged mushrooms, homegrown hot peppers. Two years and several hundred batches later, it's one of the few pieces of equipment on this homestead we have no complaints about.</p>

                    <p>This review covers what two years of actual use looks like: real power measurements, drying times by food type, durability, and whether the $310–$360 price point is justified for off-grid food preservation.</p>

                    <p>The 10-year warranty is worth highlighting. Excalibur backs this machine with one of the strongest warranties in the kitchen appliance category — and based on two years of hard use, we believe they're confident in it for good reason.</p>

                    <h2 id="what-we-tested">What We Tested &amp; How</h2>

                    <p>We tracked energy use on the Excalibur circuit with a Shelly EM monitor starting in early 2024. We logged batch start times, ambient temperature, food type, tray configuration, and end weight. Not every batch was meticulously documented — we run this machine as a working appliance, not a lab instrument — but we have clean data on over 80 measured batches across 18 months.</p>

                    <p>Off-grid setup during testing: 1,800W solar array, 7.6 kWh LiFePO4 battery bank, Victron MultiPlus 2000VA inverter. The Excalibur is one of our lightest high-draw appliances and presents no power management challenges at this system size.</p>

                    <h2 id="power-consumption">Power Consumption</h2>

                    <p>The Excalibur 3926T does not cycle its heating element like a freeze dryer — it draws a near-constant 540–580W whenever the thermostat calls for heat, which is most of the time during active drying. Power draw drops toward the end of a batch as moisture content decreases and less energy is needed to maintain temperature.</p>

                    <p>At $0.12/kWh grid rate, the energy cost per batch is negligible — well under $1.25 even for long high-moisture batches. Off-grid with solar, the marginal cost approaches zero once your system is paid for.</p>

                    <p>The more relevant number off-grid: a 12-hour apple batch at 135°F uses approximately 6.5 kWh. On a 7.6 kWh battery bank starting at 95% state of charge, that batch fully consumes available stored energy by morning with no overnight solar production. For long batches, we start during peak solar hours (10am–2pm) to maximize direct solar contribution and reduce battery draw.</p>

                    <h2 id="batch-performance">Batch Performance</h2>

                    <p>The horizontal airflow design is what separates Excalibur from stackable competitors. The rear-mounted fan pushes air evenly across all nine trays simultaneously — there's no hot spot in the middle or wet spots at the back. In two years, we have not rotated trays mid-batch once. Results are consistent from top tray to bottom.</p>

                    <p>A few notes from measured batches:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Herbs</strong> — dry thoroughly at 115°F in 3–4 hours. Full 9-tray load is feasible since herbs are lightweight and air circulates freely between leaves. Resulting product is brittle, crumbles cleanly, and retains strong flavor at 12+ months in sealed jars.</li>
                        <li><strong>Jerky</strong> — 160°F for 5–7 hours produces safe, shelf-stable jerky. We pre-heat protein to 160°F in the oven before loading to ensure food-safe temperatures even at the center of thick cuts.</li>
                        <li><strong>Mushrooms</strong> — foraged chanterelles, hen-of-the-woods, and oyster mushrooms all dried cleanly without sticking or case-hardening. 125°F for 8 hours is our standard.</li>
                        <li><strong>Tomatoes</strong> — the longest batches. Roma tomatoes halved take 14–18 hours at 135°F. Cherry tomatoes whole-dried at 135°F take 12–15 hours. Results are excellent — better than commercial sun-dried in our assessment.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2 id="durability">Durability — 2 Years In</h2>

                    <p>This is where the Excalibur separates itself from the competition. We had three prior dehydrators fail at the following points: heating element failure (Nesco), fan motor bearing failure (Presto), door latch failure with subsequent uneven drying (a cheap Chinese unit we won't name).</p>

                    <p>After two years with the Excalibur 3926T:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Heating element: no degradation, still reaching temperature consistently</li>
                        <li>Fan: no bearing noise, no speed variation</li>
                        <li>Thermostat accuracy: checked against calibrated probe — within ±3°F across full range</li>
                        <li>Trays: all 9 original trays intact, no warping or cracking</li>
                        <li>Door seals: good condition, no air leakage we can detect</li>
                        <li>Timer mechanism: smooth operation, no slippage</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>The polycarbonate door has one small scratch from a tray edge — cosmetic only. The housing exterior shows normal wear from use in a dusty workshop environment. No functional issues.</p>

                    <h2 id="off-grid-notes">Off-Grid Notes</h2>

                    <p>The Excalibur is one of the most off-grid-friendly appliances we run. The 600W draw is modest compared to a freeze dryer, pressure washer, or table saw. On a 1,200W+ solar array with even a modest battery bank (5 kWh), this machine runs without creating power management challenges.</p>

                    <p>Practical scheduling notes:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Short batches (herbs, jerky — 4–7 hrs): run during daytime solar window without concern</li>
                        <li>Medium batches (mushrooms, fruit leather — 8–12 hrs): start mid-morning, finishes by late evening, stays mostly on solar</li>
                        <li>Long batches (tomatoes, peppers — 12–18 hrs): start morning, runs overnight on battery. Plan for full battery depletion if no overnight charging source</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>The machine requires a pure sine wave inverter — not for any particularly sensitive electronics, but because the fan motor runs more quietly and efficiently on clean AC. We noticed audible hum from the motor on a modified sine wave inverter at a neighbor's property; our Victron MultiPlus produces no such noise.</p>

                    <p>The Nesco FD-1040 is a reasonable budget pick if cost is the only constraint. However: 1000W draw vs 600W on the Excalibur matters off-grid, vertical airflow requires tray rotation, and the 1-year warranty reflects the expected lifespan honestly. We burned through two Nesco units before moving to the Excalibur.</p>

                    <p>The Cosori CP267 is a legitimate mid-range option with horizontal airflow, but at $180–$220 for 8 sq ft vs the Excalibur's 15 sq ft at $310, the cost per square foot of tray area is nearly identical — and the Excalibur's 10-year warranty vs Cosori's 2-year warranty is decisive for long-term homestead use.</p>

                    <h2 id="verdict">Verdict</h2>

                    <div class="info-box success">
                        <p class="info-box-title">Our Verdict — 9/10</p>
                        <p>The Excalibur 3926T is the benchmark food dehydrator for serious homestead and off-grid use. Two years of hard use have produced no mechanical or performance issues. The horizontal airflow design eliminates the need for tray rotation, the 600W draw is off-grid-friendly, and the 10-year warranty reflects a machine built to last.</p>
                        <p>The $310–$360 price is higher than budget alternatives, but the cost is justified by longevity, performance consistency, and capacity. We would not trade it for any other dehydrator on the market at any price point. Score: <strong>9/10</strong> — the only reason it's not a 10 is the 26-hour analog timer limitation on very long batches.</p>
                        <p style="margin-bottom: 0;"><strong>Recommended without hesitation</strong> for anyone preserving food at homestead scale.</p>
